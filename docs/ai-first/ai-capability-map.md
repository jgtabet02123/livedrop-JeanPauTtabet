## Why these two
We selected **Search typeahead** and **Support assistant** because they map directly to immediate KPIs: faster discovery increases conversion, and automated answers reduce support tickets. Both use existing data (catalog metadata + FAQ markdown + order-status API), so integration risk is low and a small prototype will validate feasibility fast.
